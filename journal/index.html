        <p>This article summarizes all the best practices to use when incorporating forms into websites. Overall, the goal of using these practices is to minimize the mental load for the user which in all, improves their experience and encourages them to fill out the form. Some of the points that stood out to me that I will be applying to my design process are using a one-column layout, splitting large forms into multiple steps, asking the easy questions first to avoid form abandonment, being mindful of the label position, don't use a placeholder (this one is surprising for me), and asking "I want to _" to come up with a button label. One of the things that I strongly agreed with is having a matching keyboard type for the information needed since this has been a pet peeve of mine.</p>
